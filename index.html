							<h2>I am currently a Senior at Ramapo College of New Jersey </h2>
							<p>I will be graduating in the May of 2019. Here are some of the courses I have taken so far: </p>

								<section>
									<span class="icon major fa-code"></span>
									<h3>Web Application Development</h3>
									<p>This course taught me about the in-depth treatment of the critical languages, design patterns, and technologies underpinning all of modern web application development. I was taught the basics of networking, HTML, CSS, and also learned about using JavaScript for client side development (jQuery) and server side (Node.js).</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon major fa-lock"></span>
									<h3>Scientific Programming with Python</h3>
									<p>This course taught me about common computational approaches to solving scientific problems using Python. I learned about practical scientific applications of Python in data analysis and experimentation and developed programs using stochastic models, experimental probability and statistics, Monte Carlo simulation, regression analysis, and dynamic programming.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon major fa-cog"></span>
									<h3>Database Design</h3>
									<p>This course taught me about relational database design and SQL, along with non-traditional databases such as key and document stores. I learned about relational schema design, emphasizing normalization, ER and UML modeling, and aspects of the SQL DDL for creating constraints and relationships between data models. I also learned about SQL and query design.
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon major fa-desktop"></span>
									<h3>The .NET Environment</h3>
									<p>The course provided me with an introduction to the .NET environment- some topics discussed include the .NET paradigm, C# programming, the Common Language Runtime (CLR), GUI development, exceptions, file processing, container classes, regular expressions, GUI programming, graphics programming and Generics.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon major fa-diamond"></span>
									<h3>The UNIX Environment</h3>
									<p>This course provided me with an introduction to the UNIX (Linux) operating environment as seen from three
perspectives; (1) the user's, (2) the programmer's, and (3) the system administrator. The course
introduces common UNIX commands and utilities, file system and file I/O, shell scripting,
filters, process control, pipes, regular expressions, file globbing, and basic security permissions</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon major fa-chain"></span>
									<h3>Analysis of Algorithms</h3>
									<p>This course taught me about algorithms. There was an emphasis on the design of efficient algorithms and data structures, proofs of their correctness, and analysis of their complexity. A number of algorithmic concepts and techniques were covered, including recursion, incremental design, divide-and-conquer, greedy algorithms, amortized analysis, and dynamic programming. The algorithms studied include sorting, searching, breadth-first search, depth-first search, minimum spanning trees, shortest paths, network flow, string matching. </p>

									<h2>Motif Calculator</h2>
									<p>Program determines a motifs expected frequency.

										User inputs a specific motif - a sting of A, T, C, G's (program checks if string is valid). Next, it asks the user to enter the frequency at which each nucleotide exists in their hypothetical genome.
										
										It then calculates the probability of appearing in a sequence size N, and plots the probability of finding at least one of these motifs in a sequences of length N to 10,000.</p>

									<h2>Casino</h2>
									<p>Casino is a card game played by 2 players. The objective of this game is to score the most points by capturing cards. Two players play this game - one player will be the human user of your program, and the other player will be your program/computer. 
										The two players will play a "tournament", consisting of one or more rounds.
										Each round will consist of the two players playing till all the cards have been captured. The tournament ends when one of the players scores 21 or more points.
									The game is played similar to the description <a href="https://www.pagat.com/fishing/royal_casino.html"> here </a>. Created in C++ and also in Java using Android Studio</p>
